      para1: "I'm a new FullStack developer, ready to hit the ground running. I've taught myself the basics of web development, then completed the program at Lambda School;  now I'm ready to apply my skills in the real world.",
      para2: "At Lambda School, I studied web development and computer science. In the program, we worked with Javascript, React, SQL and Python. We built smaller projects daily and,  worked as a team to create complete products. Along with the technical work, their program gave me the opportunity to be challenged, making me quick to learn and adapt.",
